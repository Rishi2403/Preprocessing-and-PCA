# Preprocessing-and-PCA
Loaded the dataset into a Pandas dataframe.
Splited the dataset into features and target variables.
Performed data preprocessing (e.g., scaling, normalisation, missing value imputation) as necessary.
Implemented PCA on the preprocessed dataset using the scikit-learn library.
Determined the optimal number of principal components to retain based on the explained variance ratio.
Visualised the results of PCA using a scatter plot.
